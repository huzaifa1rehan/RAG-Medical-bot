**RAG Medical Chatbot**
**Project Overview**

The RAG Medical Chatbot is an AI-powered healthcare assistant that uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer medical-related queries.
It retrieves trusted medical information from knowledge sources (PDFs, research papers, etc.) and generates responses using a Large Language Model (LLM).
This ensures that the chatbot provides accurate, relevant, and context-aware answers.

Symptom-based query handling – users can ask about symptoms and get medical insights.
